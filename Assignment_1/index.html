        <p>
          We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t <br>
          always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and <br>
          accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.
