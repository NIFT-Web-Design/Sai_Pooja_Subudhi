        <h1 id="blueLagoon">MANGALAGIRI SAREES HISTORY</h2>
          <p>The Mangalagiri sarees have a history of more than five centuries. long before the sarees got
            popularised, Mangalagiri was famous for its pilgrimage .The temple of Lord Panakala Narasimha Swamy is located in the centre of the town and is believed to have been there since the Satya Yuga. It is said that under the present temple
            lies the
            former Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy
            temple, the one in which the main idol was installed by Yudhistira.
            In around 1593, during the rule of Qutub Shahi, heavy taxes were imposed on the handloom
            sarees of this region. As a result of this, the weavers started to move out of this town and started settling in other handloom centres of the state. This affected the weaving activities of this
            town. Later, the succeeding rulers of this region opted for more sympathetic practices and reduced the taxes.</p>

          <h3 id="cherry">PRESENT STATUS <br> OF MANGALAGIRI ARTISANS</h3>
          <p id="berry">Handloom weaving is the prime occupation of Mangalagiri town. More than half of the population is dependent on the cottage industry for their living. As the global demand is increasing,
            this weave can now be found on kurtas, dupattas and stoles. Nizam-Zari borders are pretty
            popular for sarees. They also make customize designs and motifs with multiple colors for sarees and dresses with the help of chhota dhabi and bada dhabi (motif making machine). Similarly, they use natural dyes now instead of chemical dyes
            because of the increasing demand of
            natural dyes. Most varieties of Mangalagiri sarees are aged back to 200-300 years other than
            some recently developed sarees like ‘muthaka’, ‘silver-jeri’ and nizam border sarees.</p>

        <h3 id="cherryT">MODERN DEMANDS AND CHANGES</h3>
        <p id="berryT">Getting raw materials for the production is also becoming difficult. Government provides an
          amount only to the owners / heads of these societies and not to the workers who do most of
          the work. 80% of the workers don’t even own a home.
          The brand that sells them cotton as raw material isn’t loyal to them. They keep hiking prices
          and ignore the artisan’s demand for specific ‘yank yarn’. The brand focus more on exporting
          the materials as there is an overseas demand for it. There is a constant hike in the yarn rates
          for 4-5 months now. Recently, yarn was sold in Rs. 200 for 4.5kgs. no price limits setting on
          yarns by either central or state government. This leads to indirect increase in the price of saree
          by Rs (100-150).</p>
