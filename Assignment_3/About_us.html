  <p>Mr Ganji Ravindranath was born in Mangalagiri, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, in February 1961. His residence is in the weaver's colony. This proud father of one runs a handloom store with his siblings (three brothers and two sisters) that sells excellent Mangalagiri sarees and textiles. He has been in business for over 45 years. Mr Ganji Ravindranath was born into a family of excellent weavers who have contributed over 100 years to this craft, so it was no surprise that he took an early interest in it.</p>
  <p>

He went to school and completed his secondary education. He learned the techniques from his father as an apprentice. With practise, he got more adept at the procedures. Mr Ganji Ravindranth is a firm believer in the importance of producing genuine handloom sarees and employing weavers. In Mangalagiri town, he is known as a Master Weaver and has employed about 1200 people, both men and women.He even owns a loom where he employs nearly 10 weavers over the age of 35, despite the government's reduced assistance in the handloom sector, with no help or benefits, he expresses his concern that the craft will die a slow death in less than 10 years due to the young weavers' constant reluctance to take up weaving as a career option.</p>
<p>

Mangalagiri sarees and textiles have enabled him to support his family while working. The government pays him 24,000 rupees a month, and he addresses the issue that the government does not provide anything to the workers who work for him. Mr. Ganji Ravindranath participated in a 1994 show in Delhi. He has also participated in shows in Ahmedabad, Bombay, and other cities. He provides FabIndia, Reliance, and Tata with fabric and sarees. Since 1994, he has done business in Delhi for a few years. Presently, he is a supplier of sarees, dupatta and running fabric to Fab India, nationwide. He has over 300 to 400 wholesale and retail clients now. He has started out online because after the pandemic now. He was also sent to Malaysia by the central government to participate in an exhibition there for 10 days.</p>
<p>

Mr Ganji Ravindranath is an industrious man with a beaming smile. He is keen to see the de- velopment of the Mangalagiri sarees and textiles and see the new generation to take up this craft. He hopes that the younger generation will recognise their efforts and popularise the craft with the global community.</p>
